## Semantic Versions
You're fed up about changing the version of your software manually. Instead, you will create a little script that will make it for you.  

Create a function `nextVersion` that will take a string in parameter, and will return a string containing the next version number.  

For example:  
```
nextVersion("1.2.3") === "1.2.4";
nextVersion("0.9.9") === "1.0.0";
nextVersion("1") === "2";
nextVersion("1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8") === "1.2.3.4.5.6.7.9";
nextVersion("9.9") === â€œ10.0";
```

### Rules
* No number but the first may be greater than 9
  * if any are, you must set them to 0 and increment the next number in sequence.  
* You can assume all tests inputs to be valid.
